**Objective**
We implemented a refactoring project for a Java application called WordFrequencyGame, we used techniques including extracting methods, removing unnecessary spaces and comments, and avoiding code duplication.

**Reflective**
non-productive


**Interpretive**
Refactoring indeed improves code readability and maintainability, the code has shortened and clear after my refactoring.
For my teacher, I realised my issue mainly lies on heavily using FOR-LOOP instead of Stream API. Furthermore, we learned method extraction and removing unnecessary elements help in simplifying the codebase.
Avoiding code duplication reduces potential bugs and makes the code easier to manage.

**Decision**
I am planning to continue applying Refactor techniques in future projects to improve my code quality.
Also, I am eager to transfer the knowledge and techniques learned with team members to promote best practices to ensure it remains clean and efficient.
